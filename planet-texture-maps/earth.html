    <h1>Planet Texture Maps: Earth</h1>
    <p>This page provides all seasons of the year on Earth. These maps were taken off of <a href="https://www.visibleearth.nasa.gov/">NASA's Visible Earth thing</a> (credits to NASA Earth Observatory). According to <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/BlueMarble">https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/BlueMarble</a>, you should credit the NASA Earth Observatory when using these maps.</p>
    <p>I had to go through the pain of the visible earth website being very slow and unresponsive by the way. I don't understand why 8 GB isn't enough RAM for things.</p>
