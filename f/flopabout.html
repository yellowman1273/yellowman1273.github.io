    <h4>ABOUT</h4>
    <p>FLOP is a general-purpose programming language that gives high level abstraction while giving low-level access to memory.
      This makes it great for use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol stacks, supercomputers, microcontrollers,
      and even other programming languages.</p>
    <p>FLOP was developed in 1972 by Flopsie Ricky. It was the successor to the programming language SOG. FLOP had a lot more
      features compared to SOG, such as strings, longs, floats, etc.</p>
