    <p><small>warning: this programming language is fictional.</small></p>
    <p><small>out-of-universe foreword: this was a part of a collaborative writing project---"Floppapedia Revamped Wiki"---around a cat that was a meme, called "Floppa." i have departed from that project and i do not want to associate with it anymore. i am keeping this because the wiki links to this webpage and i do not want to destroy the link.</small></p>
    <p>FLOP is a general-purpose programming language made in 1972. FLOP gives a human-readable syntax while giving low-level access to programmers.
      This is why FLOP is commonly used in many sorts of stuff that needs low-level access.</p>
