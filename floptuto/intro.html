    <p>
      FLOP is a programming language made by Flopsie Ricky in the 1970s. This language provides a huge learning curve, but we believe in you.
      First, we need a compiler. Download the compiler FLOPPOP by clicking <a href="https://example.com">here</a>. Now, we need an IDE, which
      is a text editor for code. It stands for "Integrated Development Environment." Download the Peercode IDE by clicking <a href="https://example.com">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we need to connect the compiler to the Peercode IDE. Open Peercode, and click on "View Compilers/Interpreters."
