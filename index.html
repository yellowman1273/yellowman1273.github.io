        Hi! I'm Isaac, but you can call me 'yellow man'. I am a Filipino junior highschool student with an interest in programming. I program in Lua, Python, and C++. Here are some of my projects:

    <h2>JogoEngine</h2>
    <p>
        A game engine using Lua. I am planning to only release 2D support once it's out, but
        I am also planning to release 3D planning in a later version. I am using LÃ–VE for
        graphics, sound, and physics (?). It's gonna be similar to Roblox Luau, so Roblox
        developers can get ahold of the engine easily.

    <h2>NationBot<h2>
    <p>
        A discord bot made specifically for a discord server called "Discordant Nations 2."
        It lets you rule a country, fictional or not fictional, it lets you control it in
        all aspects, including economy and politics, it lets you ally or become enemies with
        one another, and it lets you have war with each other.

    <h2>Wiwi Programming Language<h2>
    <p>
        A high-level compiled programming language with performance and true-to-English
        syntax as its top priority. <s>It's gonna use LLVM because from what I've heard LLVM
        helps the language Rust execute quickly. I'll do anything for a fast language!</s> It's
        currently in the planning phase, but I predict it's gonna change into the actual
        writing phase soon. The lang is named after <a href="https://floppapedia-revamped.fandom.com/wiki/Wiwi_(genus)" target="_blank">a fictional genus of cat</a> and NOT
        after the... ahem... informal Filipino term for "urinate."
