        Hi! I'm Isaac, but you can call me 'yellow man'. I am a Filipino junior highschool student with an interest in programming. I program in Lua, Python, and C++. Here are some of my projects:

    <h2>NationBot<h2>
    <p>
        A discord bot made specifically for a discord server called "Discordant Nations 2."
        It is currently on hiatus because I can't seem to find any documentation on the new
        username system of Discord.

    <h2>Wiwi lang<h2>
    <p>
        A high-level compiled programming language with performance and true-to-English
        syntax as its top priority. It's gonna use LLVM because from what I've heard LLVM
        helps the language Rust execute quickly. I'll do anything for a fast language! It's
        currently in the planning phase, but I predict it's gonna change into the actual
        writing phase soon. The lang is named after <a href="https://floppapedia-revamped.fandom.com/wiki/Wiwi_(genus)" target="_blank">a fictional genus of cat</a> and NOT
        after the... ahem... informal Filipino term for "urinate."
