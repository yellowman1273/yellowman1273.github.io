    <p>
             My name is Isaac, but people call me 'yellow man'. No, it's not because they're racist, but because my oc's skin color is yellow.
        I am a Filipino junior highschool student & programmer who programs in Lua, Python, and C++. Just like many other Filipinos, I am
        a Christ follower. I am not Catholic, however, I am a nondenominational Christian.

             I started my programming hobby in 2021-2022. I learnt Roblox game development through a playlist on YouTube recorded by TheDevKing.
        I wrote countless unfinished games on Roblox Studio before finally losing interest after getting banned for 3 days. I lost interest
        in programming in general until I believe March or April.
