    <p>
             My name is Isaac, but people call me 'yellow man'. No, it's not because they're racist, but because my oc's skin color is yellow.
        I am a Filipino junior highschool student & programmer who programs in Lua, Python, and C++. Just like many other Filipinos, I am
        a Christ follower. I am not Catholic, however, I am a nondenominational Christian.

             I started my programming hobby in 2021-2022. I learnt Roblox game development through a playlist on YouTube recorded by TheDevKing.
        I wrote countless unfinished games on Roblox Studio before finally losing interest after getting banned for 3 days. I lost interest
        in programming in general until I believe March or April.

             I longed of making a programming language that could be translated into different real-life languages (e.g. the Filipino version of
        the if/else statement would be kung/kung hindi). Before I was really interested in programming like I am now, there was this Fandom wiki
        that I would usually contribute to. It is called the <b>Floppapedia Wiki</b>. I don't know exactly how I found it but I believe it has
        something to do with a Roblox game called "Raise a Floppa."
    </p><p>    
             I was really invested into that wiki until I got bored. Somewhat recently I wrote a page of a fictional programming language called
        "Wiwi," named after a fictional genus of cat within that wiki. I ran a poll on the wiki's Discord server if I should turn Wiwi into a
        real programming language, and the majority said yes. Now here I am, planning the syntax of the language.
